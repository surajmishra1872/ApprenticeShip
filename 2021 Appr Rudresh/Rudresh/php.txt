What is stack:-(collection)
	Backend Technology Stack(BTS)


four type of s/w technology:-
	1. Console Based Application:-
							Any application which is runs on command line interface.
								Main input Device:-
									Keyboard
										e.i.:-
											MS DOS
											Linux Terminal
											Git Bash
											SVN BAsh
				Plateform Railway Services for Ticketing are the live example for the Console Based Application
					The only reason is Management Trancaction Control Mechnism

			Note:What is difference Normal and Transaction Query?

				Time and sace Complexity
				1. Unit Seconds For Time standarization
				2. Words for the Bytes and Memory allocation standarization

			Diffrence B/W Noramal query and transaction query is that 
			tarncation Queries have read and write Operation both while Normal Queries donot have, they perform single Operation at same instant.
			Either Read or write.

			Disadvantages of using transaction query:-
			1. It requires Commit.
			2. Ambiguity problem or Redundant Data 
				Explain:Generaly when ever we try to fire these Queriess if there is Syntax error is Another case but even if there is conflict with PK and FK these Query will raise Exception but query wont be stoped it will keep on Executing Untill all the record set has been written.
			3. Once Commited Exception cannot be rolled back.
			    

2. GUI Based Application:-



why does the port 80 gets block:-
				It is because your system generally(windows) has a default server installed on its environment(IIS Server) this is used by .net technology.
				Reason:-
					 By default all the request from browser to the filesystem resources is forward using port No 80.

					 if you write http://localhost:80 this will convert to
					 http://localhost
					 but if you write http://70 or 786 or any thing else it leads to error util and unless you configure a [port] to Listen apache.


in Unix lamp  dstatc present. 
WAMP(Window),XAMP(Cross plateform),LAMP(Linux,Unix)


Introduction to Xampp:-
		Xampp is a BST(backend services technology) stack software.
		X= Cross Platefrom
		AMP=(AMP stact)
			A= Apache
			M= Mysql
			P=PHP

		Accesor:-
			1. Apache
				provides resource b/w localsystem and server.
			2. MySql
				database(Mariadb)
			3. FileZilla
				FTP(File Transfer Protocol) Software
					Putty,Cyber Duck,SSh Terminal.
			4. Mercury
				SMTP

	Local Directory system on XAMPP:
			resources file
			(cgi-bin,apache,mysql,php,phpNMyAdmin,tmp are resource oriented folder
			htdocs is htdocs project level folder)


			How to request htdocs:-
				Internaly apache is configured to access htdocs  with url(C:/xampp/htdocs) this url is replaced by localhost.

 	Accesssing the resource from browser:-
 		1.using file as protocol
 		1.using http as protocol


 	Special files which are automatically loaded in the url
 		index.php
 		index.html
 		default.php
 		default.html
 		inside Apache only

 		But this can behaviour can be modified using special file
 		<>.htaccess file
  		----------------
 				It contains set of Rewrite Rules
 					RewriteEngine On
 					DirectoryIndex rudresh.html p1.html

date:19-dec-2020
 Running first php Script on localhost:
 step1:-
 	goto directory path c:/xampp/htdocs.
 step2:-
 	Make folder <test>
 step3:-
 	Make php file using any text editor.
 step4:-
 	write a Script code <? php echo "Test"; ?>
  step5:-
 	Make the request to the resource.

How to request to the Resource?
Client Server model
Here client =Browser
Here Server = It is autonomous Computer /Hardeware / Any Feeding Machine that can take input and perform the task According to your choice.
	Note: Meaning of Autonomous = donot Require any human Intervension
	In todays Scenerio we are in distributed Network System every resource is distributed.

	Requirement :-
		1. All the resources shuld be available 24x7
		2. I can Access that Resource from Anywhere
		3. Security and Backup
	Such kind of autonomous computer is called seerver. 

Types of server:-
 	1. Online server (Public Server)
	2. Offline server
		1. Virtually setup server
		2. Privately setup Server (ISPconfig)
			It is a third party tool used to setup the your own dedicated Server.
				Note: In hardware terms there are two types of server
					1. Dedicated : Are meant for serving specific server
						1. Master slave configuration based server is a Example of dedicated
						for example ganga and gomti in Urise Portal
					2. Non Dedicated : Are general Purpose
	 Online  Server: Are server from where resources can be accessed using web as a service http:// protocal ftp:// smtp://
	 WebServices : services provided by webserver is called webservices.


 	 Offline Server : Are also called LocalServers.
 	 your Simple Laptop or Pc with Good configuration is capable of becoming local server.

	 In oreder o make any computer work as local server you need a server Resource stack
	 1. After Apache Installing Your system becomes a Local Server
	 In order to work as devloper You should know server side language in such language can  be
	 php,Perl C++, Java,Python,Ruby,haskell,Scala,GO
	 PHP is server side language which can be used to make dynamic webpages 

	 Since we are require Apache+ ServerSide Language + (database) + configuration

 	 this configuration should  Ondependent of plateform

	 It is Better to go with Amp stack = Xampp





GNU 
Gnu not unix.
EoL:end of line

Note:
Non terminating behaviour  of PHP;
	if your line is the last line of a php script then termination(;) is not compulsary/madanatory

MIME type:-
	Multipurpose Internet Mail Extention(MIME) type

Supported Protocol and wrappers:-
http:// -   Accessing HTTP(s) URLs
file:// -   Accessing local file system
ftp:// -    Accessing FTP(s) URLs
php:// -    Accessing various I/O streams
zlib:// -   Compression Streams
data:// -   Data (RFC 2397)
glob:// -   Find pathnames matching pattern
phar:// -   PHP Archive
ssh2:// -   Secure Shell 2
rar:// -    RAR
ogg:// -    Audio streams
expect:// - Process Interaction Streams

Since php is devloped in c & c++  language under unix enviroment dollar "$" is the default predefine refrence variable in PHP. 
+
 Php is a secure Serverside  Imterpreted language.

 Introduction to php

 PHP Script:-
 	Any Php file with MIME type .php and Container as <?php ?> Scriplet.

 Types Of PHP Script:-
 		<?php ?> Container or php or php scriplet is important for interpreter.

 	<?php : is called opening  of php container
 	?> : is called closing  of php container
 Note that ?> this container defined EOL(End Of Line)
 If ?> is not available then last line of php scriplet must be terminated.
 This means that php files is core file


Generally there are two types of file
1. PHP core file:-
	These are the file which is only container PHP tags and code.
	e.i.:-
		<img src="helo.png"/>
		<?php echo"Hello World"?>
2. PHP Embeded File:-
	Here tag closing is compulsary

comments in PHP:-
	# is used as single line comment
	// is used a ssingle line comment
	/**/ is used as multi line comment

	For example:-
		#echo"Hello World ";
		This line wont run

		//echo"Hello World ";
		this line also wont Run

		/*
		echo"Hello World1 ";
		echo"Hello World2 ";
		echo"Hello World3 ";
		echo"Hello World4 "; 
		*/

	I/O stream  in php
	How many ways we can print output in PHP
	echo
	print
	print_r
	printf
	sprintf
	exit
	die
	vprint
	vprintf
	fprintf
	vardump


How to take Input:-
	fopen("STDIN") is used to read user input in command line
	Details from php.net

STDIN define interms php://input
STDOUT define interms php://output


	How to declare variable in PHP:-
		since PHP is developed using c,c++ written and Developed under Unix Environment $ is Reserved refrence variable.

	Variable Refrencing:-
	 $$ Operator: It created variable to variable Referincing

	 <?php
	 	#wap in php to echo $
	 	$x=2;
	 	echo $x;//2


	 	#variable to variable Referincing 
	 	$x="ravi";
	 	$$x=2;//$($x)=2 //$(ravi)=2
	 	echo $x;//ravi
	 	echo $ravi;//2
	 ?>

Do phpPHP require Xampp server to be Kept On?
Yes: If you are Localhost to Access php file as resource
No:Using php Command line in this php file is directly taken a input by php interpreter and desired output is generated.


Since php command line does not have any predefine scanner class or function to read input stream or buffer from command Line.


How to make our scanner function in php and write it to a file and import when required.
+
Steps:1 Make a file named scanner.php
Steps:2 file name:scanner.php
<?php
function input($msg){
	$buffersize=1024;
	echo $msg,"\n";
	$input=fgets(STDIN,$buffersize);
	return trim($input);
}
?>
How to import scanner file:

include'scanner.php'
$x=input('Enter a No: ');
echo $x;



Explanation for scanner file
============================
function input():function is keyword to make user defined function
	input($msg):$msg is a formal argument

$buffersize=1024:
	$buffersize is a simple variable which stores 1024 number of character space.

$input = fgets(STDIN,$buffersize):
	1. fgets:it is a function which is used to get the no of characters from a file or any Stream(I/O Stream)
	2. STDIN : Read from Standard Input buffer or stream.
	3. $buffersize: Php Interpreter => Memory space reserve Max of 1024
		-------------------
		|m1|m2| ...|m1024|
		------------------
	Since php is dynamic language run time memory allocate takes for less no of character.
trim(): It trims illegal characterset like Extra spaces,\r,\n
return:returns the trimmed value from the function.


2include :  It is a predefine function of PHP used to Import any resource.
include'scanner.php' is same as import statement in Java same as include in C language.

Question:WAP for the following:
1. area of circle using radius as a input from the user 
2. find  the sum without + allowed. 
2. find  the sum using +,/,* and - but + not allowed. 




Exponent Operator Introduced in PHP7.0
Exponent Operator:
	2^3=8
	2**=8

Php interactive mode: In python there is chevron>>>2+2=>4
to run interactive of php:
	php -a Command to open Interactive
	ctrl+c to exit.

	php- -a
	Interactive Mode Shell
	php>
	without using php Tag
	single line code or expresion



Diffrence B/W language construct and functions:
	Function: Parenthesis() Compulsary
	print_r(),printf()
	language Construct :Parenthesis() is not Compulsary 
	echo,print

Diffrencd B/W echo and print:
	echo: echo is used to print multiple argument.
	print: Print it prints single argument at time;

	echo arg1,arg2,arg3...argn; as same as
	print arg1;
	print arg2;
	print arg3;
	print argn;

Diffrencd B/W echo and print_r:
	echo is a Language Construct but print_r is function
	echo can be used to print primptive datatype
	e.i.:-
	echo 10;
	echo "hello";
	echo 'h';
	echo "This is sentence";
	echo true;
	echo false;
	echo 12.25;
	But it cant print Array
	If you use echo to print Array it will 
	Notice Error saying Array to string Conversion Error

	print_r can be used to print array

	best is print_r 


Diffrence B/W echo and printf():
	printf():printf() is called formating print it supports format specifiers
	which can be used to format the output while printing.
	printf() is function not language construct.

Prototype of printf
	printf(<[Output-string]>,<varg method>)
	output string means: Any thing printed inside " " and ' ' are(double Qoutes or single Qoutes are printed on the Output Stream)
	<varg method>: defines the variable set or arguments with placeholder value.
	Note: printf() is same as c printf()
	place holder value means: $x=2 variable name $x and placeholder value=2
  
	supported format specifier:
	1. int->> %d since php is dynamic language signed and unsigned also long and very long
	2. charracter data type :This is not supported in PHP
		Why charcter data type is not supported in php:
		#in order to answer such question we should be clear primitive datatype concept
		primitive datatype in PHP:
		------------------------
		1. int
		2. float or double
		3. boolean
		4. string
		5. NULL as a datatype 
		Note: In php NULL is the predefine Dataset

		WAP IN php to display the datatype of primitive datatype
		in order to print type we use gettype()
		$x=10;
		echo "The Type of",$x"is",gettype($x);


		$a="helo";
		$b='helo';
		there is a diffrence B/W '' and " " but datatype remains the same.  

The predefined data type of Any Input Stream or Output stream the return type is usually The highest datatype Available

In our case if you using Scanner function it returns every value in <string datatype>

Warning Error : Non numeric value Encountered Error
This erroe is raised whenever there is confusion b/w String datatype and int datatype

$a="10  ";
$b="  20";
echo


Non numeric value encountered error is a special error due to very special concept called  type juggling.
consider following example.
$a="10 ";
echo gettype($a);//integer
$b=" 20";
echo gettype($b);//integer
$c=$a+$b;
echo $c;
echo gettype($c);//integer
A non well formed numeric value encountered in php.


echo "result = ",$a+$b;
result = 30

echo $b+$c;
A non well formed numeric value encountered in php.


echo "Result is : ",intval($a)+intval($b);//type casting
Result = 30

echo "Result is : ",intval($a+$b);//type juggling
Result =PHP Notice: A non well formed numeirc value encountered in php shell. 
30

when does stack trace error invoke:
	When error in syntax
	#0{main}
		thrown in php sh=ell code on line...............




Special behaviour of boolean value in PHP
-----------------------------------------
1. true and false is a logical entity.
logocally represent true=1
false=0
in case of php
int(true) =>1
int(false) =>0

but without int true ===>1
false => "Nothing or empty "

what is the formate specifiers?
for the following:
==================
int-->%d
string-->%s
character-->%c[test]
boolean-->%d 

Postmortem of Printf():

1. By default it support single Argument.
printf("Hello world"); 
printf('Hello world');

printf() accepts firsts argument as a mendatory argument.
this first argument can be  two type:
1. Constatnt or literal
2. Variable
in this case behaviour of printf()--->print

$x=10;
printf($x);//10
$y=10;
print($y);//10

You can also print formated string using printf()
any thing written " " or ' ' Qoutes inside printf is treated as formated string

echo "Hello world"; //Printing String
printf("Hello world");//formatted string
printf('Hello world');// not a formatted string

Consider following example
printf(10,20,30,40);//10
printf(20,10,30,40);//20
printf('20',10,30,40);//20
printf("20",10,30,40);//20
printf(100);//100
printf("100");//100
printf('100');//100
printf(hello world);
//PHP Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected identifier "world", expecting ")" in php shell code on line 1
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected identifier "world", expecting ")" in php shell code on line 1

$hello="hello world";
printf($hello);//hello world

What is formatted string?

Formatted string=Plain String + Convertible string
Plain string: Any string inside single qoutes or double qoutes which printed as plain text is called plain string.

for example
==========
printf("Hello World");
printf(;Hello World');

We can print any thing inside and double and single .
 printf("$ @ # *  ... a-z A-Z 0-9");
 But you cannot print two special reserved symbols

Ginger technic or string manipulation:
 

you can print every character in printf but can not use defined printf()
printf("$x")//it will replaced by $x= value
note that echo "$x" will print $x= value
it is nothing related to output function rather it is telated to " " Such behaviour is called string interpolation
and to make varibles readable


{} Variable place holder/or ginger techinic
{} : length 0 it will print as it is
{$x}: print the variable value.

$x=20;
printf('$x');
$x
printf("{");
{
printf("}");
}
printf("{}");
{}
printf("[]");
[]
printf("()");
()
printf("{$x}");
20

$x="Ravi";
$$x=10;
echo "{{$x}}";
{Ravi}
echo "{${$x}}";
10


What is Paamayim_Nekudotayim error
============
:: is called as scope resolution operator. It will be very usefull in case of accessing  static members in any class in object oriented in case of php.

% and \ are the reserved convertable Operators

% and \ they  will print as plain text but convert into a special behaviour

convertible string are prefixed by two operators
1. % as a prifix => formate specifier
2. \ as prefix => escape cahracter sequence
	\ is known escape operator.

Escape(skip) Operator
===============
Whenever you use \ operator it has nothing to do with Second Argument
printf("...") only with First Argument.

Behaviour of printf :
====================
1. If ' ' or " " are not used the behaviour of printf becomes to be print and echo.
important interview Question based on
Escape Operator
1.How will you print \ using printf
	printf("\\");

2. What does escape operator internally do
	\ escape operator convert convertible string to plain string.

3. How to print \n inside printf()
	printf("hello \\n world");

4. How to print %d inside printf()
	behaviour of escape operator can only be change by its operator itself
	 printf("%%d");

5. How to print % inside printf()
	use %% to escape suffix %


6. Can you tell me a special operator which cannot be escape by \
	% modulo operator

7. can you tell a special digit which  cannot escape by \
	\0


Some of the important escape character sequence
\a : alaram Beap
\f : form feed
\b : backspace
\v : verticle tab
\t : horizontal tab
\n : new line
\r : return carriage 


formate Specifiers:
=============
1. %d : integer
printf("The number is %d");

Argument List [<...>] : is the no of supplied argument seperated by commas(",") in any function as single argument entity.
Q1. 

for example
printf([arg1],[arg2,arg3,arg4,arg5...]);valid
		|1		1	2		3	4|
									|2

printf([arg1],[arg2],[arg3],[arg4],[arg5]);invalid
		|1		|2		|3		|4		|5
Total no of argument=5
Total no of entity=5

Example:
	$a=10;	
	$b=20;
	add($a,$b);
	total no of argument=2
	total no of entity=2
	$a=10;
	$b=[10,20,30,40,50,60...]
	add($a,%b);	

print_r([arg1] ,[arg2]);
printf([arg1],[arg2,arg3,arg4,arg5]);
printf(arg1,arg2);





most  common error while using format specifier 
Few Argument supplied Count error
	if you using min 1 format specifier and not supplying argument list too few argument supplied error will raise.

printf("%d",10);//10
printf("%d %d",10);//php warning:printf(): too argument in php shell code
printf("%d %d",10,20,30);//10 20

character in dynamic typed language:
	character data type = 
	1. gettype():string
	2. strlen(): lenght in digit
		 if length == 1 it is a character  else string
		 This can be using ord() function.

printf("%d",true);//1
printf("%d",false);//0
printf("%s",'false');//false
printf("%s",True);//1
printf("%f",false);//0.000000
$a=10.5;
echo $a;//10.5
$a=10.0;
echo $a;//10
printf("%f",false);//0.000000
printf("%f",0.0000001);//0.000000

Sprintf(): it is same as printf but it do not print anything it returns.


printf("This is no value =%d",10);
This is no value =10
sprintf("This is no value =%d",10);

$a=sprintf("This is no value =%d",10);
echo $a;
This is no value = 10

diffrrecne b/w printf and sprintf:
==================================
$x=printf(10);//10
echo $x;//2


$x=printf(1000000000000000);//1000000000000000
echo $x;//16

$x=printf("awanish");//awanish
echo $x;//7
$y=printf(10);//10
echo $y;//2
$y=printf(printf("awanish"));//awanish7
echo $y;//1


Question:-
	1. WAP to take the input from the user as a name.
	and find the length name .

	Running php script as a python script [standAlone script] or tagless Script.
	1. little slow.

	wap to make a expression based calculator ?
	inorder to solve any expression we can use eval() to evaluate a expressin as a string.

	limitation of using eval()
	eval() can be used to evaluate the expression as a string it may contain keyword or variable as string.
	for example
	 This is valid
	  $i=10;
	  eval("if($i==10){echo 'hello';}else{echo 'hi';}");//hello

	  $i=8;
	  eval("if($i==10){echo 'hello';}else{echo 'hi';}");//hi

	 1. eval() does not support assignment operator if you try to execute this then d'code() error is raised since it is  		parse error no output is going to generate.

	 2. PHP community it self discourages the use of eval().
	 It is dangerous to use.

	 Advantage:
	  1. Donot allow any script specially to run enclosed as <?php tag?>
	  2. Using eval() expression you donot required wrapper tags or tag container it is you need not wrap your code inside
	  <?php tag?>
	  example:
	  <?php echo 'hello world'?>

	    eval("<? php echo 'hello world'; ?>");//parse Error unexpected EOL at line no something unexecpted '<'
	  

	  PHPRun compiler it is Best Example of eval()
	  1. phprun.bat
	  			run.php

	  	phprun
	  			Environment

	  	eval();
	  		|---->FILENAME----->Run.php

	  	code:phprun <filename>
	  			|
	  			|-------->Command Line Argument
	  	php -a
	  	eval("echo 'hello';");

file_get_contents():
	It is used to get all the content from the file and return them as a string.


Command line Argument in PHP
============================
Till know that we can take input using scanner method implemented by us.
No of ways taking input.
1. using Scanner calass/Method
2. Command Line Argument

Command line argument are the compile time inputs.
Generally there are two types of input:
 1. runtime input
 ===========
 	Example: Input is given after programs starts running
 	java p1.java
 	Enter your name : input supply

 	in python
 	python p1.py
 	Enter a number : 2
 	Enter second number : 2
 	4

 	in PHP
 	php p1.php
 	Enter a name : awanish
 	awanish

 2. compile time input
 	javac p1.java 2 2

 	python p1.py 2 2
 	4

 	php p1.php awanish
 	awanish

 wap to emplement command line argument----
 php has inbuilt variable set : super global varible
 for example: $_POST,$_GET,$_REQUEST.......$_FILES
 $argv : it is a super global varible which is used to accept the argument varible from the compile time input or (command line argument).

print_r($argv);
1. compile time Input
2. Its datatype is array
3. These value are space seperated 
4. arguments supply its personal index by default 0 index is reserved for file name
5. $argv is a dynamic array list
6. by default it support all the type of data type  but string should be applied in " " only.
7. it is a hectrogenious array
8. $argv() is the super global varible used for accepting command line argument
9. no other super global varible can run other	than command line argument.
10. By default datatype of each argument inside command line argument is of string type
11. By default size of $argv is 1.
12. Min size of input is 1.
13. min index of $argv is 0.


date:28/12/2020

Assumming php for loop to be same as C for loop write a program to find the sum and average of input supplied from the user any number without using scanner class.
program:-
=========

<?php
#wap in php to find sum and average using command line argument
//print_r(sizeof($argv));
//print_r($argv);
$sum=0;
for($i=1;$i<sizeof($argv);$i++)
{
echo "{$argv[$i]}";
$sum=$sum+$argv[$i];
}
echo "The sum is {$sum}\n";
$avg = $sum/(sizeof($argv)-1);
echo "The Average is = {$avg}";
?>


#wap in php to find sum and average using command line argument without sizeof

offset error in $argv
java index out of bound error is same as offset error in php
If you try to get the value of such index or key which donot exist in array of php it will lead to offset error

for example

php p1.php 10 20 30
total size : 4
[0] -p1.php
[1] - 10
[2] - 20
[3] -30

if we try to get value of index greater 3
$argv[4]
$argv[5]
$argv[6]
$argv[7]
$argv[8]..............

Notice or Warning Error Undefined offset error

Minimum and  maximum index of $argv
-----------------------------------
$argv is special array because in normal array min = 0th Index
here 1st Index is min
because file name is at index 0
$min = $argv[1];
$max = $argv[sizeof($argv)-1];
$max = $argv


Calculating the size of any array
1. sizeof()
2. count()

What is the difference b/w sizeof and count:
============================================
1. count : Used to static array Run Time
2. sizeof : Used to Dynamic array compile time

<?php
#wap in php  to show use of sizeof and count
print_r(count($argv));//1
echo "\n";
print_r(count($argv));//1
?>


alternate of size of array

Algorithm for calculating the size of array.
Suppose : $a = [10,20,30,40];
$a[0] = 10 $a[$i]=10 where $i=0;
$a[1] = 20 $a[$i]=10 where $i=0+1;
$a[2] = 30 $a[$i]=10 where $i=1+2;
$a[3] = 40 $a[$i]=10 where $i=2+1;
$a[4] = '' or false  $a[$i]='' where $i=3+1; in general $i=$i+1;
$a[5] =''
$a[6] =''
$a[7] =''
$a[8] =''

$i=0;
while(true)
{
	if($a[$i]=='')
	{
		break;
	}
	$i=$i+1;
}
echo $i;

NOte: @ is called error handling operator. Ot is used to hide Notice and warning error. 



Difference b/w single Quotes('') and Double Quotes(""):
According to output string there are teo type of strings in php 
1. processed string:denoted by ""
2. Unprocessed string(raw string):denoted by ''
Invalid case:
"" inside "" : invalid X Manage using escape operator
'' inside '' : invalid X using escape operator
"" inside '' : valid
'' inside "" : valid

Process String : " " each character is first processed then sent to output stream.
1. varible inside "" are processed then printed
2. escape character sequence inside (\n,\t,\r,......) are processed



Raw strings : '' NO processing each character printed as it is directly flush to output stream.
1. varible itsef is printed
2. escape character sequence inside (\n,\t,\r,......) are not processed printed as it is

Common Behaviour:
if you try to use <html> tags inside "" or '' it is treated as string for printing html you can only '' or "" Quo4tes no issue at all.

Running PHP WebServer On command Line
-------------------------------------
php version 5.5.6+ php donot require any webserver it has its own inbuilt CLI serever

command : php -S localhost:<port-no>
example:

	php -S localhost:8888

Date:29/12/2020
Request and request forwarding in php CLI server:
	1. php 5.5.6 provides inbuilt web server support .
	It do not require any other servers like Apache for testing purpose
	But inorder to deploy your project built on php will require certain resource like smtp, mail services, database driver such type of resource can only possible with multi purpose server.
	so Apache is a goog choice for all C-Panel in web-hosting

	ngix Server is also good choice for all Cpanel in Web-Hosting

	2. php CLI server uses your Operating System environment Access and uses it since every command is executed from command line priority is highest
	For Example:
	Which file will be processed first placed at c:/xampp/htdocsat port :8000 
	[Apache is a third prty services] it is using 8000 port but termperory asign
	or
	 c:/users/path/to/file at port :8000 
	 [use php CLI server has highest priority due to cmd line hence port is reassigned]

	 3. If you  try to access resource ata a port which is already reserved for system sppecific services then such port cannot be assigned.
	 Before you assign any port to php CLI server use "neststat -a" to get list of all TCP/IP port List.

	 4. Command to run php CLI server : php -S localhost:portno
	 5. Each request is processed by a foreign Address ::1:[Any port No]
	 6. As soon as port is assigne following things takes place
	 	1. port is assigned
	 	2. foreign Address is reserved
	 	3. Document Root is created 
	 	4. Request is sent to index.php file if not then to index.html if not to 404 error
	 but every request can be re-routed using any router.php(any file) file.
	 php -S localhost:8000 index.php (code Ignitor 3,4.0 , yii)
	 phalcon framework re-routes request in router.php

//SAPI= Specific Application Programming Interface


How to run server to any target location or SAPI:-

create a folder test
test
	public_html//folder
 		css/js/images//folder
 		index.php//file name
 		server.php//file name

 		command:-
		mkdir test//test folder

		cd test

		mkdir public_html

		cd public_html

		start notepad index.php

server.php:-
	<?php
	$uri= $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
	echo $uri;

index.php:-
<?php
echo " This is Public file welcome to my Framework";
include '../server.php';
?>

This project  can be run by two ways
1. php -S localhost:8000

	Working with Webform in PHP:-

	(WHATWG): Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group is responsible for concept called user interactivity by introducing the concept of web form
	1. HTML Form
	2. Web Forms 2.0
	3. Advanced Forms 3.0 [html 5]
	First web form was launched on 2004

	============================
	How php related to web form
	============================


	Web application
			html/css/sass/less/botstrap/mediaQuery

			JS= prgromming language  -->Interpreter
			php= programming language --> PHP Interpreter

	JS work on the basis of event
	PHP work on page submit/load event
		1. page load: you are requesting for a page URL
			when ever a page is called (Resource) then browser will a create  or make a Request it will to server 

			c--->s<--->Nic database  select * from marks_table where 
			roll no <---> return   roll no zzzzzzzzz;


	Syncronous programming:
			All the resource, Devices hardware will wait and untill and 1 response processed.

	Asyncronous Programming : Nodejs

	All the resource, devices, hardware does not to wait requestwill be accepted from all but delivered once which is processed first.


	Page loading:-
	1. form submit <form></form>
	2. using anchor tag <a href=""></a>
	3. using shadow load [At network Layer]

	Question:-
	Consider a progream with js and php code inbuilt together 
	<h1>
	<?php 
	$arr=[10,20,30,40]
	?>
	</h1>

	<?php print_r($arr);?>

	<script>
	var arr=[<?php echo $arr; ?>];//var arr=[10,20,30,40];//jass(javaScript syncronous script)
	console.log(arr);//[10,20,30,40]
	</script>

	1. Complete the code at line 1207

	answer: Js it work on text or tag
	request-->page call-->resource-->MIME type-->File(.php)-->Apache-->
	php://[interpreter]
		php code
			plain text
				browser
					plain +HTML tag
						DOM tree
							Javascript



	WAP to dynamically accept the input from the form and disply on another page.

	FileName:input.php

		step 1: Analyse the page load Event
		step 2: if it is using <form> tag
					1. action attribute compulsary <form action="output.php">
						if action="" is self or empty
						action="input.php" or action=""
						submit the form at this location

		# is called fragment Identifier
		and will be a key concept spa application (single page Application).

		navigator location Api to change # convet into /

		<a href="javascript:alert('hello')" title="">GO to row 4</a>

					2. if action is available onsumbit attribute is checked
					<from action="output.php" onsumbit="return false;">

	Task : perform client side validation onsubmit attribute
	name: blank
	mobile: blank and length
	email: type="text" empty and @ and dot.

	Regular Expression(RegEx):
	==========================
	Regular expression means the entity or string consisting of many number of character with a specific index position such that it forms a unique or format.

	for example:
	Vehicle no.
	UP63 N7398
	01>= state code
	23=> district code
	4=> space
	N7398=> pattern

	Regular exapression Index set are Evaluated and it return true if format set match the character index set.

	$pattern = "[9|8|7|6]{0}"

	{0} =In {} is called index set
	|   = delimeter
	[]  = Character entitiy
	All the allowed character set are return inside []
	[abcd] only a,b,c,d are allowed. 

	Consider this example Mobile: 8299502081
								  ^
								  mobile [0] match with $pattern
								  it evaluates to be true

	Real time example:
	1. ctrl+f matches and find the matched pattern.
	2. Email Validation in web application


	Note:
	 Comment Line:
	// single line
	/**/ multiline comment

	Regex
	/[a-z]+/ Non Length Based Regex
	/^[a-z]{}$/ Length based Regex

	// Unparsed Token

	Postmortem of Regular expression:- 
	==================================
	Refrence : Mastering regular Expression Oriely publication.(book download)
	 1. Wild card character set:
	 	Thesde are just like operator or reserved symbol of regular expression 
	.	wild card character
	()	Substring or sub pattern 
	-	range (a-z A-Z 0-9)
	[]	character set entity all list of  allow character are placed inside it.
	{}	No of valid character count including character set

	Example:-
	[a]{1}[a-z]{5}
	[a]{1}][w]{1}[n]{1}[i]{1}[s]{1}[h]{1 
	}

	a at 0th index :-



	[com]	length is : 3  == min length 3 
	[com] {2} Invalid

	[com] {3} == [com] true

Date: 01/01/2021

	1. Goto browser press ctrl+shift+i or F12 for Developer Tools
	2. Goto console mode

	Initilize the regex by var regex=/^Pattern$/
	use regex.test("<input string>") return true or false

	Other wild card character set:-
	. =period
	()
	[]
	{}
	-
	Note : All the reserved symbol to be used in regex can not be directly used for pattern matching
	[[]] invalid
	We can use escape operator sequence to stop or to ignore being parsed
	[\[\]]

	Meta pattern fixing:
	====================

	[a-z] regex.test(input)

	Any character specified outside the charater set[] will make its fixed position for the given expression that means it will become are part of pattern with that symbol being mendatory.

	Example:
	@[a-z] This means before matching  a-z pattern sequence @ is Mendatory.



	Reserved meta Operators:-
	=========================
	For example:-
	a-z 26 character set of Alphabatic letters
	 \d 0-9 digits Non case sensitive
	 1. every meta operator is followed by escape operator.
	 2. It specified unique Range set

	\w : a-z word list 
	\s : space allowed
	\S : space not allowed
	\W : lower a-z not allowed 

	Context rammer rule:

	No meta operator should be alone used in character set
	meta operator will never used outside of the character set.

	 ^[\w]{6}$/;// invalid regex

	Quantifire:
	===========
	^n : starting of a pattern
	n$ : ending of a pattern
	^ donot include
	[a-z]{6}
	[0-9]{10}
	[^\d]{10} is same as [not a-z]

	3. after client side data is validated 
		1. How to send the data to the server on clicking submit button
		2. How to send data to the server without submit button
			Ajax <input type="button">


	4. Considering submit from submit button
		1. Identify the method the method type by default method is Get Type 
		<form action="output.php" onsubmit="return validate();" method="get"> 
		<form action="output.php" onsubmit="return validate();" method="post"> 
		<form action="output.php" onsubmit="return validate();">
		by default method is get
		

	Difference b/w get and post:
	============================
	 1. GET is a by default method of form tag.
	 	Post is Strict method of form tag.
	 
	 2. GET is a insucure method 
	 	Post is secure method

	 3. Get result in the generation of QueryString
	 	POST does not generates QueryString hence the data is sent in Encoded Standard and data remain hidden.

	 	Explanation:
	 		Any string in url followed by ? as a key and value pair seperated by & is calld QueryString.
	 		in GET Request : ? = 1
	 		Multiple QueryString are used in framework
	 		Rather in post ? = 0
	 		Output.php?name=rk&gender=male&email=rk@gmail.com

	 		? = Query Mark 
	 		name,gender,email = key
	 		rk = value
	 		& = seperator

	4.	In GET request only limited amount data cane be sent to the server.
		But in post request more than 1024 character set can be supply.

	5.	In GET Request File can not be uploaded
		In POST request any file cane be uploaded infact infact a Movie of 5Gb
		but server must allow In apache server Max_upload_limit = 2MB	
		to change Max_upload_limit php.ini

			enctype=multipart/form-data is important to be used with post method in case of file uploading.
			Explanation: When ever a data is sent to the server
			1. url
			2. header:
					content-type:application/json
					https_client: off
					ssl_peer_verify: true
					....
					..
					..
					.
					cache-expiry:100ms
					pragma:
					We modify header for downloading Images
					header("Content-Type:application/Raw-data");
			3. body:
					Formdata
					Formencoded data
					raw data / json data

					How to send data in json format
					data:json
					content-type:application/json
					Encoding: UTF-8


					{
						"NAME":"Rudresh",
						"gender":"male",
						"file":"usydguydgyysgdudgfugdfduhdbuvbuybsuycuycuyycsguyucyduycuycdyjfjfjfcgjufjgvvuvjuvjvgugvvgjuvgyuvgvucgydbbdcugbgubugbguugbgybuugybgybgbygyububfyuybuybgugybugybugybugybugybgubyugyb=="
					}

	6.	GET request are cachable(cach memory = 64kb)
		POST request are not cachable

	How many type are storage in your browser
	1. Seccion Storage
	2. Cache storage
	3. Local Storage
	4. Web storage
	ctrl+shift+I>>application layer
	hard refresh  and clear cahe:
	ctrl+shift+i rigth click on reload empty cache only for chrome


	<link href="mycss.css?version=1.1">
	<link href="mycss.css?version=<?php echo time(); ?>">


	7.	GET request can be BookMarked
		POST request cannot be Bookmarked


	8.	GET request do not have any additional security can be publically Access
		But in post request some token has to be supplied and this token is called CSRF(Cross-Site Request Forgery) security

Date : 05/01/2021

	CSRF(Cross Site Request Forgery):-
	==================================
	Prevention has to be done in case post request only not recommended incase Ajax Request.

	forgery attack server work for match data from database
	1. Domain Address (IP Address)
	2. Data
	3. Timestamp
	4. CSRF


	Request handling in php:-
	Here we respond according to the legal request only
	and request can be found using $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']

	How many types of request:-
	1. GET
	2. Post
	3. put
	4. patch
	5. delete
	6. options
	7. lock
	8. head
	...
	..
	.

	Most widely used request are
	1. GET : Show the record / record
	2. Post : You want post or add some data
	3. put : changing complete data or updating fully
	4. patch : partially update patch change password is example of patch request 
	5. delete : Destroyies the record/Response


	http request with database:-

	CRUD : 
	C : Create data insert
	R : Read/Retrieve select
	U : update  data update
	D : delete  data delete


	Note: Http protocol version:
	http/1.1
	http/2.1

	create => HTTP /1.1 POST 200 OK
	read => HTTP /1.1 GET 200 OK
	update => HTTP /1.1 PUT 200 OK
		   => HTTP /1.1 PATCH 201 CREATED
	delete => HTTP /1.1 DELETE 200 OK
		   => HTTP /1.1 GET 404 NOT FOUND

Date : 06/01/2021

	Creating unique identity for forms for serverside :
	Any form control either it is input type=box,radio,button,checkbox,date,time,file everything should that have a unique name this can be supplied by using name attribute.
	<input type="text" name="something">
	Note taht name attribute value becomes key ata the server sider 
	if GET Request
	print_r($GET);

	Array([something]=> 10)
	if post Request
	Print_r([something]=> 10)

	2. Name attribute should be uniqe and case Sensitive
	3. If request is sent using GET then name attribute is accessible using $_GET
	4. If request is sent using POST then name attribute is accessible using $_POST
	5. if you do not want to care about method type you can go for $_REQUEST which is Independent of Method type

	Super Global Variable in PHP:
	Super global variables are used predefined in built special variables used to get the value from any scope

	Scopes:
	1. Local Scope
	2. Global Scope
	3. Client Scope
	4. Server Side Scope

	There are two types of super global variable
	1. Mangled Variable : _  will be used as a prifix
	$_POST
	$_GET
	$_SERVER
	$_REQUEST

	2. Unmangled Variable : they donot start from _ as a prifix
	$GLOBALS

	These superglobal variables are:

	$GLOBALS
	$_SERVER
	$_GET
	$_POST
	$_FILES
	$_COOKIE
	$_SESSION
	$_REQUEST
	$_ENV

	 =================================
	|superglobal = unmangled + mangled|
	 =================================

	Note: Name Mangling
	class Test{
		public $name;//no any underscore for public
		protected $__class;//double underscore for protected
		private $_marks;//single underscore for private
	}

	There context are super means the can be access any where.

	Super Gloabl variables in details:

	1. $GLOBALS:
		It convert any local variable to super global variable and this variable is formed such that it becomes umangled variable.

	2. $_GET: To receive variable or formdata from GET REQUEST
		can be receive if query is generated
		Query string each variable will a key in $_GET
		?name=ravi
		$name =$_GET['name'];
		$name =$_GET['calss'];
		echo $name;
		echo $class;

		Invalid :
		$name =$_POST['name' 9];
		echo $name;//undefined Index name Notice Error

	4. $_REQUEST : To receive variable formdata with any REQUEST $_GET or $
		$_Request : variable is independent of request type or it can handle both the request get and post<br>
		$_REQUEST = $_GET + $_POST 
					? [n>1]	?[n=0]
		if ?n=1 get key1 $_GET => $_REQUEST

	How to generate PATCH REQUEST and PUT REQUEST:-
		We know that if we want to update any data in the database then we have to send either put request or patch request.
			fully update =>[Put] request
			partial update =>[Patch] request

		Query for PUT:
		Database S6chema
		---------------------------
		Tablle  :  Student
		---------------------------
		id | name | class | marks
		01 | ravi | 12	  | 00
		02 | chavi| 10	  | -10
		---------------------------

		update student set marks = '100' where id='01'; Patch Request

		Fully update => Fully changed in value of auxillary Column set.
		___________________________________________________________________
	   |Auxillary Column Set = total columns - (No. of PK or Composite key)|
	    -------------------------------------------------------------------

	   if n=3 request Put
	   if n<3 rquest Patch

	   inorder to sent both the request use ?query string and method = "post"
	   ?query string keyname =which is unique and will not be changed.
	   ?id=121

	   post => whose value ca be changed name,class,marks


	$_SERVER:-
		It is the super global variable used to get the server configuration like hostname,host agent , server variables, query string, methods, type of request, types of headers, server signature,.... etc

	What is Activity Tracking in Server?
	Generally ther are two type of resources
		1. Serverfull
		2. Serverless

	Serverfull: Serverfull resources acquires complete tracking of user and they response over the server few or mor resources can not be shared in if resources is accessed from server protocol medium.
	PHP
	Trackink: enable or  disable
	1 => Enabled
	0 => Disabled


	Serverless: Serverless respurces acquires incomplete tracking of the user and they can resopnse over the server without direct intervention of server.
	They are not tracked by any server in this case in serverless resources can access any type of data from any source.
	HTML
	Trackink disable
	Explanation :
		$_SERVER : complete array of server configuration and setting.
		$_SERVER stores the meta_data for the server configuration and its Environment, etc.

	How to check tracking enabled or disabled:
	$_SERVER['HTTP_DNT'];
	Any request : http/1.1 GET OK
	DNT : Response

	How to GET Query String from server:
	$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']

	How to get remote ip of a client
	$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']

	How to get complete url
	$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']

	How to get current file name
	$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']
	$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']


	How to get method type
	$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']

	How to get Server protocol
	$_SERVER['SERVER_PROTOCOL']

	HOw to get server host
	$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']

	how to get root of project
	$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT)']

	HOow to get Port no
	$_SERVER['SERVER_PORT']

	6. $_FILES : This super global variable is used to handle file uploading in server.
	Files can be of any type
	1. Binary
		Example: Media File, mp3, mp4, pdf, zipped or any other MIME type.
	2. Non Binary
		Example: All text format files are non Binary Files
		.tmp
		.log
		.txt
		.dat
		.doc
		.csv
		.html
		.xml


	Uploading means:
		Read from one source and write one another source
		Read from one destination and write to another destination.


	Copy and move
	Copy: first create the file
			read the from 1-file
			write another 2-file
			memory release of file pointer

	In C Language:COPY
	File* fp1;
	File* fp2;
	fp1=$File;
	fp2=$File;
	fp1=fopen("c:/somethng.txt",r);
	fp2=fopen("d:/somethng.txt",w);

	while($ch=fread(fp1)!=EOL){
		fwrite(fp2,$ch)
	}
	fclose(fp1);
	fclose(fp1);

	Move:	first create the file
			read the from 1-file
			write another 2-file
			memory release of 2-file pointer
			fseek(-1)

	Steps how to upload files on server:
	Internal Working: 



	whenever we try to upload any file then a upload request is generated and file pointer is intialised.
	Who Intialised the file pointer : 
	Inbuilt server is responsible for Intialising the file pointer
	1. Apache
	2. PHP CLI Server

	By default file pointer has  source address of tmp folder located in server folder of any server
	Apache : tmp root
	php Inbuilt Server : php tmp folder

	What is this tmp folder;
		1. It is default folder where every file handling is performed by server like storing file based session by file name sess_....
	 	2. Using any file with .tmp extension 

	 	Such path is define inside php.ini file

	 	Now the file which is to be uploaded from the browser required key parameters
	 	1. file_uploads=on in ini setting of server
	 	2. Ptah should be available to tmp folder
	 		upload_tmp_dir= define the path
	 	Note : in ini file ; means disable to enable directive removr semicolon(;)
	 	in httpd.conf # means disabled to enable # remove hash(#)
	 	3. File uploading in browser is now ready
	 		steps for code
	 		client side
	 		<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
	 			<input type="file" name="xyz...">
	 			<input type="submit" name="btn">
	 		</form>

	 		server side code
	 		print_r($_FILE);
	 		it is a two dimentional array
	 		name key : name of the file
	 		 tmp_name : file address of tmp folder
	 		error : it show the error if happened during upload
	 		size : it give the total memory reserved by tmp file

date : 09/01/2021
	Validate File uploads
	=====================
		Loop hole:
			Error is used to detect error but this error is related to processing or illegal error but not valid or used defined error.

	$filename =$_FILES['keyname']['name'];
	$error = $_FILES['keyname']['error']; #processing error

	========================
	State management in PHP:
	========================
	state mange means tracking user state(location path) where user migratetd.
	TWO type of state : previous and forward state
	How many ways we can handle state

	1. Using url:
		We maintain the state or current url of user using Query String.
		state should be maintain from the page itself
		make a key in url and note down the current page name or its url
	<form action="valid-upload.php?/=<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);?>" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
	or
	<a href="target.php?/=<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);?>"></a>
	then you can header(location) using keyname /
	for example:-
		header("location:{$_REQUEST['/']}");

	Checking set and unset variable:
	--------------------------------
	isset: isset return true or false for weather if a variable is defined or not 
	<?php
	$x=10;
	var_dump(isset($x));//bool(true)
	?>	

	unset: same reverse  of isset it destroys the defined variable or key.
	<?php
	$b='rudresh';
	echo $b;
	echo "<hr>";
	var_dump(isset($b));//bool(true)
	echo "<hr>";
	unset($b);//destroy 
	echo $b;//undefined index $b : notice error
	echo "<hr>";
	var_dump(isset($b));//bool (false)
	?>

	How to set default value to a undefined variable:

	We are going to use ternary Operator for such logic

	General synatx:
	---------------
	<expression>?:[true]:[false];
	Loop hole with echo:
		Since echo is a multi argument language construct it can not be used to as a part of evaluated expresion.
		$a=echo('print');
		echo $a;
		Parse error: syntax error, unexpected token "echo" in C:\xamp\htdocs\php-class\st-and-unset-variable\ternary.php on line 13 

	ternary perator:
	if value is unsset then undefined index error will raise.
	we need to handle that
	There are two possible ways
	1. Suppress operator (@)
		(@) is used to hide notice or warning error
	2. Using ternary to handle unset variable
		ternary operator can be used to aasign a default value if they not defined

	special care must be taken for GET variable


	Difference b/w is_null, empty and isset:
	Note:: empty($name) or $name=="" are same
	Note:: In php NULL is not equal to blank
	Note:: In php blank== empty=='' or ""

	empty()0 : blank is not allowed isset() True $name=""
	is_null() : variable is defined with value NULL $name=NULL isset() True
	isset() : variable is defined

	isset > empty() > is_null


	2. Using Session:
	3. Using File handling





	Working with Session Super Global Variable.
	$_SESSION: Is a super gloabl variable which can be accessed

	GIT

	DevOps : It is  not a technology but a culture in IT for software, Modelling and Production according to SDLC.

	SDLC:
		Software Development Life Cycle

	In SDLC there were several model proposed by different engineer and IT experts
	1. Waterfall Model :-
		-----
			|Requirement Analysis or Study
			-----
				|Design
				-----|Coding
					 ----|Testing
					 	-----|Maintaince
					 		-----|Delivery
					 			---------
	Each phase must be complete with 100% Accuracy why because undo is no possible.
					
	2. ProtoType Model :
				We prepare a ProtoType
				Requirement full and final
				Desiging full complete
				Time line is very good

	3. Spiral Model :
				Each loop represents modularity and project is highly flexible
				work load distributed

	4. Evolution Model :
				spiral + waterfall = MashUp

	5. Scrum Model(Agile Model) :
				Its follows WBS(work breakdown structure) Architecture : 
				Team Work
				1. Coding Team(collabes 5) 5 copies 5 Branches(Dev Environment)

					Designer : 5
					Coding : 5
					Testing : 5

				2. Operational Team(collabes 2)
					Sales : 2
					Instaling : 2
					Delivery : 2
					Client Handling : 2




	If yiu are working in a distributed system there should be some central server where every developer can submit there project or code such type of machanism is version control Mechanism.
	Small small of code Source or module is called Scrum

	Tools avaliable in market is called as versin control softwares:
	SVN : (Sub Version)
	GIT  

	Such Type of mechanis or culture running in IT Company Is DevOps
	Developer + Operational 


	GIT:-
	=====
		Stages of Git:
			All these stages are at local system.
			
			Untracked	unmodified	modified 	Git

	Your project is backuped at three levels
	1. Cache(Staging)
	2. .git folder
	3. Remote server

	"add" command to untracked to git(staging)
	Working git Terminal :
	ls : list out all the files
	pwd : print working directory
	ls -lart : show hidden files list
	ctrl+ font up
	ctrl- font small
	arrow keys Command history
	clear used to clear the screen

	Important commands for working with .git repo:-
	-----------------------------------------------

	1. How to create or set up global signature
	git config --global user.name ""
	git config --global user.email ""

	2. Create or Intialise .git repo
	git init

	3. How to cross check
	ls -lart

	4. How to create Resource
	touch <filename.ext>
	example:-
	---------
	touch index.html
	touch about.html
	touch contact.html

	5. How to create folder
	mkdir <folderName>

	6. How to track level of your project
	git status -s : for short description
	git status : long  description

	difference b/w git status and git status -s
	git status -s : It should tracking activity of files
	git status : branch name
				 last commits
				 Tracking levels of all files

	7. How to add file to staging
	single file:  git add <filename>
	git add -A
	Multiple : git add --all

	If you want to track complete current directory.
	git add .

	How to disable tracking 
	remove the file from staging you need to clear cache
	git rm -- cached <filename>
	Note: Each tracking must be commited other wise cached will conflict
	then you need to force fully remove the file.

	You can raise flag -f flagfully
	git rm --cached <filename> -f

	Commit story:-
	every file must be commited
	git commit -m "Message any valid"

	Gives you intire log for the commited changes
	git log

	commited file is created by unique id of 40 random character bits

	How to get back last commited result
	git checkout <filename>

	How to know current Branch
	git branch

	How to create new branch
	git branch <branchname>
	example: git branch ravi

	show that branch
	git branch

	How to switch branch
	git checkout branchname

Date : 11/01/2021

	Q:-
	what is diffrence b/w git clone and git init:
	Git init is used when we want to start the project scratch.
	branch:master/ main

	clone means making changes in existing  project then we need to clone it

	clone: public repo
	clone: private repo (ssh key: rsa key Ciper code)

	clone is performed to make changes like maintanance, deploying new functionality or testing.

	How clone url looks:
	http://someclouds/downloads/myfiles.zip
	https://github/rknirala/mycustom-project/myfiles.git
			↓			↓		↓			  ↓
			git url/author_id/url_project/.git repo


	what is git repo:
	Any project having .git folder initialised becomes a repository
	public repo : url it is globally accessible
	private repo : only can accessed by loginned user one having ssh key



	How to manage tracking of all files other than few files:

	git add --all
	git add -A
	git add .(include folder)
	remove the files which you do not want track
	git rm --cached <filename>


	best ways is: 
	to .getignore file

	what is .gitignore file:
		it is a special file which trackes untracked files and do not add them to staging.

		touch .gitignore

		Note : git do not track any files registered inside .gitignore file
		If you want .gitignore file itself not to be tragged you can add .gitignore inside .gitignore but getignore will not be added in satging Area. then next time when you want to clone the project you wont be able to know which files to working under tracking and which file to ignore.


	git labelling:-
	.git*
	.gitlock


	git diff command
	----------------
	used to find out the diffrence b/w last commited code with the latest modified code.

	git diff <filename>
	for example:
	git diff index.html

	how to checkout last code from a file:
	git diff <filename>
	git diff index.html

	how to checkout last code from a deleted file
	file name is missing
	checkout the branch 
	git checkout <branch-name>
	git checkout master
	you will get deleted filename

	git status 
	deleted : filename
	git checkout filename



	How to auto add and commit to staging:
	=======================================
	git commit -a -m "Any message to the existing code..."
	git status
	you will no status tree is clean


	How t check out full
	git checkout -f

	-f flag will revert back all the changes from the project of current branch

	Q1: A empty folder can not be tracked?
	Ans. : Minimum one file must exit

	Q2: Checkout cannot be performed at one condition
	Ans. : In case of git init
	since there is no commit file checkoout  cannot be performed untill and unless initial commit.

	Terminology
	1. git repo : any project having .git folder will called as git repo.
	2. master : it is main branch of your project(Main Developer).

	How to work with GitHub or Any Remote repository---
	----------------------------------------------------
	There are millions of online server which allow VCS(Version Control System) Intregation 
	VCS  here refers to version control system which means you have multiple developers working under agile model or scrum model
	scrum or sprint model

	each(scrum) sprint is commited by diffrent devloper as a collab
	and each scrum is a part of a branch

	GitHub is a popular online server mostly use for submitting or commits
	Is GitHub only the possible way:
	No, we have bit-keeper (Git older Server Repository), bitbucket, aws, GitLab.

	GitHub Owned by Microsoft.
	You can create two types of repositry:-
	1. Public : Any one Using Internet Can access.
		Clone : No permission is required in pull.
		push: Requires Permission and credentials
		collab: Requires Permission and credentials
		forks: Requires Permission and credentials


	2. Private : You are the owner with Single Access.
		clone: Requires Permission of the Owne for pull and such type of request is called as pull request.
		push: Requires Permission and credentials
		collab: Requires Permission and credentials
		forks: Requires Permission and credentials


	How to create fisrt repo
	========================
	1. Login to GitHub account
	2. Access code may be asked to login into your gmail and get the OTP send by GitHub
		[May or May not be]
	3. Create Repository on the right hand side
		before you create a repo you should have
		following  Things ready
		1. owner ship type : public or private
		2. Unique url for repo (repo-name)
		3. RaedMe file (optional) : It is local Documentation
		4. .gitignore file (optional) : Which files or folder to commit or not
		5. (optional) : Licence
		6. tag line or discription : Information about the project.

		create the repository



		How to switch branch
		git checkout <branch-name>
		head ->employee
		Ownership is created master will never know that ravi branch has been created.

		How to push the code  to server
		1. Add the remote url
		git remote add origin <url>
		git remote add origin https://github.com/rudreshmzp/techpile
		git remote add origin <https://github.com/owner_id/repo-name>

		How to confirm Origin
		git remote -v
		git remote add origin https://github.com/rudreshmzp/repo-name(fetch)
		git remote add origin https://github.com/rudreshmzp/repo-name(push)

		for push 
		git push <origin> <branch-name>
		git push https://github.com/rudreshmzp/repo-name/master

		you have any other branch
		git push https://github.com/rudreshmzp/repo-name/rudra
		git push <origin> rudra

		


		origin is variable name
		git remote add url https://github.com/rudreshmzp/repo-name

		push in the url
		git push url master
		git ask for the credential and push the entire with the branch.

		How to clone the project
		git clone <public-repo>
		git clone <private-repo> <ssh key>

		How to setup a New branch and switch to it 
		git branch
		master existed

		Now create the new branch
		git checkout -b <branch-name>
		$ output : creating a new branch and switching

	Using QueryString for Notifications:
	====================================
		Single QueryString : ?keyname = value
		multiple Query string : ?keyname =value & keyname2 =value2 & keyname=value3.......
	when ever you work with Query string there are multiple cache related problems like autofilling

	autocomplete = "off"
	tag level : <input type="text" name="name" autocomplete="off">

	Xss Filtering in PHP : cross site Scripting

date : 17/01/2021

	How to hide foldr or file from indexing in Apache:
	By default out of security concern few files and folder in apache is restricted to appear in indexing
	such files header.php and public_html  ..  etc in server configuration.

	Such configuration can be modified using .htaccess

	IndexIgnore *
	where * is a wild card character for disabling all indexing

	ignoring any folder 
	IndexIgnore folder-name or filename
	IndexIgnore *.php

	How to protect Directory Access
	Options -Indexes to disable indexing
	Options +Indexes to enable indexing

	How to modify configuration without using .htaccess file:-
	==========================================================
	We have  to use server configuration using virtual Host

	Goto xampp/apache/conf/extra/httpdvhost.conf
	<virtualhost *.portno>
		DocumentRoot "Path/to /your files"
		<Directory "abspath/to/file">
			Deny from all
		</Directory>
	</virtualhost>


	How to disable a folder from accessing but allow for indexing
	<virtualhost *.portno>
		DocumentRoot "Path/to /your files"
		<Directory "abspath/to/file">
			Option -Indexs
		</Directory>
	</virtualhost>


	Regex in php:-
	==============
	We can use pregmatch function to check validity of regex in php
	syntax:-
	if(pregmatch(<expression-of-regex>,<subject>)){
		//if matched
	}else{
		//if not matched
	}


	task 
	implement form validation using regex and server side validation on target page
	for following fieldser
	1.Full name
	tp trim space from left and right
	2.Mobile number

	Sanitisation in php:-
	=====================
	XSS Filtering : Preventing user or hacker from injecting any other script such that it do not enables php to execute.

	XSS means Cross Site Scripting

	some times you may require tags or some time may not require
	for example:
	<h1>Hello</h1> from text box when submitted generates Heading tag with Hello

	Insuch case we need to remove tags
	strip_tags() removes the tag

	in some case entities are not required
	htmlentities() prevents  from generating html entities

	If you want to generate it
	html_entities_decode

	in some cases you may require tag for generating presentantion
	htmlspecialchars() which automatically converts tags to special character set such that all the code is printed in raw format.

	Make a user define function to perform XSS filtering

	function sanitise($arg){
		$arg = strip_tags($arg);
		$arg = htmlentities($arg);
		$arg = htmlspecialchars($arg);
		$arg = trim($arg);
		return $arg;
	}

	Write a program for small blog application where user can post its php codes based on topic
	<?php
	$title =strip_tags($_POST['title']);
	$content =($_POST['content']);

	echo "<h1>".htmlentities(trim($title))."</h1>";
	echo "<hr>";
	echo "<xmp>".$content."</xmp>";
	echo htmlspecialchars($content);

	?>

	write a php code to take user information with following field:
	1. Name
	2. Mobile
	3. Email
	4. Gender
	5. Address
	6. Country

	display two buttons first btn show preivew and second btn edit 


	Global Autoloading :-
	=====================

	Some times you may require few files to be automatically loaded in a such a cse it becomes very hactics in that case why not to make your own autoloader and let autoloader and let autoloader include all the files anywhere.
	make a file init.php
	<?php

	$autoload=['errors','functions'];
	foreach($autoload as $key => $value){
		include "{$value}.php";
	}

	?>

	in root folder place .htaccess file
	RewriteEngine On
	php_value auto _prepend_file 'init.php'

	Note : init.php must exist
	File name can be Anything Whenever



Date : 18/01/2021
	How to get :
	<form action="somepage" method="get||post">
	<input type="text" name="aa"/></form>

	how to set value value on input box
	you can value attribute
	$name = 'ravi';
	I want to put this value by default in text box
	1. <input type="text" name="name" value="ravi"/>
	for dynamic 
	1. <input type="text" name="name" value="<?php echo $name; ?>"/>
	if amy error is raised it will be visible on the page 
	in ctrl + u (view  psge source).

	Multiple redirection error:
	===========================
	It is a error when request send by the header becomes recursive which leads to infinite looping and page donot respond
	Such erroe is called redirection error.

	If you have get request and header("location:<target>") is called to same page at the get request then such error is seen

	for example:
	input.php
	header("location:input.php");

	How to reset the form fields after form submit:
	===============================================
	 Generally for better response you can take user redirect from current page another page.
	 
	 but for resetting the form fields on the same page 
	 multiple ways
	 1. using header location:
	 	here we can use header location and pass som e message with Query string and later on use it as a flash-data
	step 1:

	include 'error.php';
	include 'function.php';

	step 2:
	$msg['register-success'] = '<span style="color:darkgreen">'$#10004;Registration done</span>;

	step 3:
	header("location:input.php?msg=register-success");

	step 4:
	<?php show_errors();?>

	Case 2: 
	alert using php
	 echo '<script>window.alert("your message");window.location.href="input.php"</script>';

	case 3:


	Case 4:
	 using pure javascript
	 createa a common class-name
	 class ="input-box"
	 and generate script tag dynamically only when form is submitted 
	 $submit = true;
	 After body tag:
	 <?php if($submit==true){?>
		<script>
			var classelement = document.getElementsByClassName('class_name');
			for(var i=0;i<classelement.length;i++){
				classelement[i].value="";
			}
		</script>
	<?php }?>


	how to get and set in select box
	<select name="city">
	<option value="mzp">mzp</option>
	</select>
	$city = $_POST['city'];
	echo $city

	Set:
	You have make selected attribute dynamic
	<select name="city">
					<option value="Select" <?php if($city=='Select'){echo "selected";}?>>Select</option>
					<option value="Delhi" <?php if($city=='Delhi'){echo "selected";}?>>Delhi</option>

	</select>

	Working with session:-
	======================	
	Sessions are the tracking timestamp for any event.
	Whenever the session is started a event timestamp is generated.
	By default in php it exist till 1440 second (24 Minutes).
	can it be modified yes How?

	php.ini
	session.gc_maxlifetime = 1440 if you modify this

Difference b/w  session_unset, session_destroy and unset($_SESSION):-

session_unset:
	STUDENT_ID t1 same time stamp is destroyed
	or TEACHER_ID t2
	or PHPSSID t3

session_destroy:
		Teacher => Timestamp teacher PHPSSID
		student => Timestamp student PHPSSIDstudent

	session_destroy : PHPSSID t1
	or TEACHER_ID t2
	or STUDENT_ID t3

	when you use session_destroy All the session token with timestamp will be destroyed


unset:
	It only destroy session current token not the timestamp.

When session_unset and session_destroy works same
when session token is same

Important topic of session:
===========================

1. session_token :
Name of the token which is shared among browser and server.
	it is the name of the cookie.
	c=client
	c=cookie
	s=server
	s=session
	session token name is same as cookie name which is stored in browser
	in server:
	session_token = PHPSSID

	in browser  or client:
	coookie_name = PHPSSID

2. session_timestamp : 
		By default the session time out for a guven timestamp is 1440 second
		But since timestamp is not sent to browser.
		cookie will never expire rather replace same with the token name.

		How to expire cookie:
			since timestamp is a independent unit and time cannot be <0
			hence timestamp cannot be destroy.

			Then how to clear the cookie or expire the cookie:
				How to set the Cookie
				setCookie('user','name',time()); 

				This logic will be useful in case of Remember me.

	How to replace the existing Cookie
		setCookie('user','new_value',time() -300);


	How to expire Cookie
		setCookie('user','',time()-300);

3. session_save_type:
	where server will store the file 
	1. in filesystem :  c:/Xampp/tmp/  90% security (no tracking)
	
	combination of file system + database =100%

	2. database(10% security)(tracking 100%)
		tbl_session
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		id 	|Token_name	|created_on|expired_on	|session_id	|	IP_address|
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. session_savepath :
	By default session where in C:/xampp/tmp
	one file is created with name
	sess_<session_id>

	How to trace this file or change the path of this file
	
	-------------------------------
	to get path
	ini_get('session.save_path');
	-------------------------------

	-------------------------------------------------
	to set path
	ini_set('session.save_path','C:/xamp/newfolder');
	-------------------------------------------------
	before
	session_start();

5. session_id :
	It is a encrypted hash key with alphanumeric Id given to a user everytime a new timestamp created

	How to get session_id :
	session_id()
	But if user can get your session id it can perform session Hijacking or session
	fixation

	How to prevent
	After new time regenrate the session_id
	session_regenerate_id()

	example:
	echo "sess_".session_regenerate_id();
	exit;

	What is session Hijacking:
		Trying to imitate as a original user even without knowing credential and fooling server by showing session_id to remain un_caught.

How session Works:-
	Once users enters his/her username and password  such that it is authenticated from server and database end server is going to maintain the user state for tracking its activity.
	This tracking will be done for the specific span of timestamp which bydefault is 1440 seconds
	If user want to timeout or expire this tracking session before the timestamp time he/say may use to go for logout option and timestamp + token given to user will be expired.

	Now question ... How server Identifies this user uniquely
	step 1: Authenticate the user
	step 2: Alot the encrypted unique session id with a timestamp to each user
	step 3: The copy of token is saved in cookie
	step 4: When ever the request for the asme url is called everytime before giving access to user server is going to match this token.

	If given token in cookies is == to session token being store user is valid 
	else server kicks him out.

=================================
Working with project Architecture:
=================================
htaccess inheritance:
Multiple htaccess can be maintained in the sub directory or root directory
priority of the chile htaccess is highest

1 : rules are Inherited from parent  .htaccess
2 : Child htacess rules are applied
3 : Child rules override parent Rules 


myproject
	|
	|blog-application
	|		|
			|web-apir
			|web-app
			|	|-->.htaccess [child]
			| .htaccess[parent]

			parent =>rules apply
			child =>rules apply
			child rules override parent rules



Using Modular Approach:
	General files are kept in root folder
	web-app
		|---->index.php
		|---->contactus.php
		|---->register.php
		|---->login.php

	Break the role in modules
	make a folder user or student or teacher or admin

	web-app
		|---->index.php
		|---->contactus.php
		|---->register.php
		|---->login.php
		admin/
		user/
		teacher/
		student/

How to make your own package and load automatically:
==========================================
make a folder of any name add some file into it and go to 
config/config.php
$autoload['folder_name'] = array('file_name without extention','file_name without extention');

Date : 24/01/2021

InterOperability using Json or YML:
==================================
Communication b/w two independent languages.
Using API's
Mode of channel : Internet (WEB-API)
data format : XML,JSON,YML (Highly Recommended)

APP1(PHP)<----API---->APP2 (JAVA)
language A <-----data> language B
API: Application Programming Interface.

to add password configuration in phpMyadmin
goto xamp/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php

/* Authentication type and info*/
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] = 'cookie';#config changed to cookie


Sample of API Code with API_KEY
API_KEY has following names Auth_key,Secret_key, Auth_token,API_TOKEN,...etc.
But Industry standard is based Upon JWT(Json Web Tokens)


Data Representation using JSON:
==============================
JSON : JavaScript Object Notation
It is common mode of data Transmission or Representation

Few Terms in JSON
-----------------
JSON Data is Combination of key and value pair

JSON Object
{
"key" : "value"
}

JSON Object By Multiple keys and value
JSON DATa
{
"key" : "value",
"name" : "ravi",
"class" : 12,
"marks" : null,
"passed" : true
}

How to make multiple data in JSON object:
-----------------------------------------
JSON Array:
{
	
	"Hobbies" : ["singing","dancing"]
}

student for ravi Using Json:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

student :Ravi
{
"key" : "value",
"name" : "ravi",
"class" : 12,
"marks" : null,
"passed" : true,
"Hobbies" : ["singing","dancing"],
}--->0

student : manas
{
"key" : "value",
"name" : "ravi",
"class" : 10,
"marks" : 0,
"passed" : false,
"Hobbies" : ["singing","dancing"],
}----->1

Array of objects

{
	"data" :[
		{
			"key" : "value",
			"name" : "ravi",
			"class" : 10,
			"marks" : 0,
			"passed" : false,
			"Hobbies" : ["singing","dancing"],
		},
		{
			"key" : "value",
			"name" : "ravi",
			"class" : 10,
			"marks" : 0,
			"passed" : false,
			"Hobbies" : ["singing","dancing"],
		},

	]

}


Serialise and deserialise

How to check the response using JavaScript
document. 

PHP objects with Stdclass
Serialization : Converting one type off objectto another  type ob object 
php object converted to JSON object
API encoding

If you are using  API then we must set Content-Type using headers

How to write json response to json file
for that we have two ways 
By request to json url
http://www.rknirala.gov:8000/php-class/InterOperabilityy/objects.json

1. Either create Objects.json file and write the data to the file and you can access that file fromn url

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+).json$ objects.php

How to create dynamically Json using php:
Explanation  : using file handling

Step 1: fopen the file
fopen("filename","mode");
mode =>r,r+,w,w+,a,a+



date : 25/01/2021

+plus : extended
without + :  Strict Mode

r : read only No write Operation :Strict Mode
r+ : read and write Operation : Write extended

Step 2: Initialise the file pointer
$fp = fopen("output.json","r");

Step 3:
check if $fp is Null
if($fp==NULL){
	die();
	exit();
}

Debugging Functions:
	This functions are used for debugging point of view

1. die() : It terminates the execution of script at a perticular Point with any message
2. exit() : Same as die(); The only diffrence is exit support 0-255 Index Numbers

3. var_dump : It can dump every thing about a variable or variable  dumping
	$arr = array(10,"20",true,[10,20,30],10.5);
	var_dump($arr);
	$arr is a Array
array(5) { [0]=> int(10) [1]=> string(2) "20" [2]=> bool(true) [3]=> array(3) { [0]=> int(10) [1]=> int(20) [2]=> int(30) } [4]=> float(10.5) }

var_dump is support multi argument
var_dump($x,10,20,30);

var_dump is not a language  Construct : paranthesis are mendatory
var_dump$x;


var_dump can be used to print objects

class Test{
	public $a=10;
	public $b=30;
	public $c="Apple";
}
$obj = new test();
var_dump($obj);

4. print_r:
printr for  debugging means Printing in a Formated Way

<?php
echo "<pre style='background-color:black;color:white';font-family:rockwell;>";
$arr =array(10,20,30);
print_r($arr);
echo "</pre>";
?>

Question 1:
Diffrence b/w echo and var_dump
1.	echo  cannot print array
	var_dump cann print Array

2.	echo can not print Boolean false
	var_dump can print boolean false

3.	echo is  language construct
	var_dump is not a language construct but support argument under single parenthesis

Question 2:
Make a user defined function called prx() print and exit for debugging purpose it can print any type of DataType in a formattable Order

function prx($arg){
	echo "<pre>";
	if(is_array($arg)){
	print_r($arg);
	}elseif(is_null($arg) or is_bool($arg) or is_object($arg)){
	var_dump($arg);
	}else{
	echo $arg;
	}
	echo "</pre>";
	exit;
}

function pr($arg){
	echo "<pre>";
	if(is_array($arg)){
	print_r($arg);
	}elseif(is_null($arg) or is_bool($arg) or is_object($arg)){
	var_dump($arg);
	}else{
	echo $arg;
	}
	echo "</pre>";
}


After Checking for Null
=======================
You can perform read write Operation 
read : fread()
write : fwrite()

Read
fread($fp);

write
fwrite($fp,"Line of code");
close the file
fclose($fp);

writing the data at once:
file_put_contents("output.json", $json);

Reading the data at once:
$data=file_get_contents("output.json");

#wap in PHP to read/Write the data at once  in a file for api
Write:

<?php

$student = new StdClass();
$student->name ="Rahul";
$student->mobile ="7839179059";
$student->email ="rk@gmail.com";

//Encode it into Json
header("Content-Type:application/json");
$json=json_encode($student,JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
// Used to write complete data into a file
file_put_contents("output.json", $json);
?>

Read:

$data = file_get_contents("output.json");
var_dump($data);

Decoding from json string
inorder to decode the entire String we can use json_decode() to Convert Json_STR to native PHP DtatType

Syntax: 
json_decode(<json_str>,<to array>[default= false]);
Return Type : Object | Array | Key



How to decode  the entire json string to array
Syntax:
$data=json_decode(<json_str>,true);
echo gettype($data); //array

Ilterating through Object

foreach($json_array as $json_obj){
	echo $json_obj->key_1;
	echo $json_obj->key_2;
	echo $json_obj->key_3;
	echo $json_obj->key_4;
	.............
}


Ilterating through Array

foreach($json_array as $json_variable){
	echo "$json_variable{['key_1']}";
	echo "$json_variable{['key_2']}";
	echo "$json_variable{['key_3']}";
	echo "$json_variable{['key_4']}";
	.............
}


Question: What is difference b/w json_encode and json_decode
Answer : 
1	json_encode: Converts PHP native Objects to json object string
	json_code : Converts json_string to php native DataTypes which will be object if second argument kept as false and array if second argument kept true.

Asyncronous programming in PHP:
==============================
Asyncronous means doing multiple task Parellely.
Syncronous means doing task one after the other it will wait till the First task is completed.

Why do we require Concept of Asyncronous Programming:

It is because JS is event based and PHP is page load based(Response)
if event occurs Response will wait
Response will Occur then event will wait
Deadlock condition will occurs
That is why we need Asyncronous programming
This can be done using concept of ajax


Ajax:
=====
Ajax : Asyncronous JavaScript and XML Response : Content-Type : application/xml
Ajaj : Asyncronous JavaScript and Json Resopnse : Content-Type : application/json
Ajay : Asyncronous JavaScript and Yml Resopnse : Content-Type : application/yml


how to acchieve: 
================
Vanilla .js or pure JavaScript
var http=new XMLHttpRequest();
	http.open("url");
	http.send("url",true,"GET/POST");
			   |	|		|
			   |	|		|Method get or post
			   |	|is Asyncronous
			   |url wher to send data

Using Jquery
$.ajax({
	url:"getdata.php",
	datatype:"JSON|XML|YML|text",
	type:"GET|POST",
	success:function(response){
		//js code
		//code is key in json Object returned by PHP
		if(response.code==200){
			//js code data Binding
		}else{
			console.log(response);
		}
	},

});

How to JS and PHP Parallely:
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/js.php"></script>

How to js.php

<?php
header("Content-Type:text/javascript");
?>
var base_url ="<?php echo AJAX_PATH;?>";
window.alert("hi");

if you try to include any php file in a root folder
then autoloader configuration must be required

go to admin/ folder 
copy  .htaccess  file 
kepp in any Custom root folder you created. for example (php_js)

Register the definition and path for php_js
inside php_js
	|---.htaccess
	|---myjs.php

goto config/config.php
$modular['php_js']='php_js';

Ambiguity in ajax Request:-
Since each and every request is processed via serever timestamp for each request is calculated tracked by server Any request with same Identity will processed first which is arranged in Memory stack first.

That is why each request must be sent Uniquely
For example:
for Email:

http://localhost/myproject/blogapplication/web-app/ajax/check_email.php = valid request for http/1.1 OK

for Mobile:
http://localhost/myproject/blogapplication/web-app/ajax/check_mobile.php = valid request for http/1.1 OK


	
	email 			mobile 				  xyz
	|				|					  |		
	|				|					  |
	|_______________|_____________________|
				server




How to hide extention using htaccess:-

RewriteRule ^(regex_match)$ <resource_name>
Note that query string is allowed in case of Rewrite Rules

Magic Constants in PHP:-

All the variable must be define with prefix $ and function with suffix () paranthesis.
But Constants are define in UPPERCASE and with not prefix and suffix

How to make constant in php-:

define('Constant_name',value);

how to use:
echo CONSTANT_NAME';

All constants are global can be Accessed Anywhere
Scope of Constants : Global

Write a program to define Your Own User defined Constants.

example:
define('GRAVITY',9.8);
echo GRAVITY;

function test(){
	echo GRAVITY; //9.8
}

//calling of test
test();//9.8

define('GRAVITY',10); // Cannot be Reasigned

Magic constant are predefine constant in php and capable to providing runtime values

These magic constant have __ as prefix and __ as suffix

1. __FILE__ : Give the entire path for a file

example: file name header.php
echo __FILE__;
C:/xampp/htdocs/path/to/folder/layout/header.php

2. __DIR__ : Give the entire path for a file parent folder

example:
echo __DIR__;
C:/xampp/htdocs/path/to/folder/layout/

3. __NAMESPACE__ : Give the name_space name
4. __CLASS__ : Give the Current class name
5. __LINE__ : give the line Number where execution is done
6. __FUNCTION__ : Give the function of being Called
7. __METHOD __ : Give the method name of a class
8. __TRAIT__ : Give the Trait name (Multiple Inheritance Expection)

__NAMESPACE__, __CLASS__, __METHOD__, __TRAIT__

How to take backup

cd/
wmic ** /f
@echo off
echo --loof --are

windows R
%temp%
you will get the backup in folder with name
window/iuedfyqwgtyaiuuhsgasv

Output buffering:
=================

Output buffering means sending the data to the buffer memory before sending to it to the browser
This is very Internal Function
Source code
		|
		|----->php
				|
				|----->buffer memory(Output buffer) 4096 character allow by default php.ini can be modified 
						|
						|----->browser

we know that in the Output the most and first thing sent to the browser is header but if you are rewrite Engine you will definetly modify some header

in such case we need to clear to output buffer
1. ob_start() :: Starts Output Buffering
2. ob_end_flush() :: end the output buffering and sent the Browser

Error :: Headers Already
