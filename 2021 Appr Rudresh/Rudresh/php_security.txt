PHP Security:
=============
In a small scale application traffic and no of request are very less will never intrest a hacker to perform any attack on your application.

but on Enterprise Application(s)

Now consider a banking application which process the millions of request per/second in that case that site very very prone to hackers

If your application has millions of request per second or per minutes congrats you are in the vision of hacker.
Your Application must be prevented by common Attacks.
1. Common Skill set
	1. XSS Attack
	2. CSRF Attack
	3. SQL Injection
	4. de-hashing :: decrypting the hash
		hash: alpha numeric bit for any data and this has unique.
	5. Brute-force Attack
	6. session-hijacking
	7. click-jacking

2. Forensic Tool [Paid Tools]


XSS Attack :: 
	Hacker will inject some piece of code like html,javascript,php script,python  geenerally scripting language and it will start executing the script such attack can be used to manupulate the behaviour of Application.

	XSS Filtering or prevention :: 
		Accsess filtering can be done by santizing the Input function
		WAP to make sanitise function


Session-hijacking:
	In this attack hacker will try to steal the session of a user and pretend to be real user and pretend to be real user.
	Is called session fixation(fixing)

	prevention:
	session_regenerateid()
	new session will be created.

	in all get request session id will reamian as soon as some post request fired try to regenerate the session

Brute-force Attack ::
	Problem : if captcha is not used hacker can use a script por bot can the tabs for example 100 tabs
	and submit the same username and passsword (or different) at a single reqest in case server cannot respond to each request

	request 100/second
	response 1/second
	hence server will collapse

	Prevention :: Use the captcha
	what will happen :: it will generate new captcha for each request which need to solved nd then for is submit.

Captcha:
Completly Automated Turing Test(program) to tell computers and humans Apart

Types of captcha

1. Text captch : Text captcha can be copied and pasted
2. maths captcha : Text cannot be copied bot can solve the simple expression
3. image captcha : 
4. puzzle captcha :: google recaptcha v2,v3

Captcha can be easy to every complex
we can be made by increasing Font,Mixing different Colors,Shades and jumbeled words
It is recommended to go for Alpha Numeric string set


For alpha numeric string we have to make pre define formate
for example:
fd45af

write a function to give alpha numeric 


1. Download the Captcha Font
and make sure the font is of .ttf extension(true type font)

2. place the font in the same directory where captcha is load

3. Make a file called captcha.php

Note: Image in php are generated using gd library
Graphic Driver library and is pre-installed in php package

How to check
open php_info
or open cmd 
php -m

gd library may be uninstalled may not be on so make sure you uncomment the GD Library Extension in php.ini
;extention=gd2 # remove the ";"

Now we need the cocept of Computer Graphics of vector form and roster form
Refer to following diagram

Encryption in PHP:
==================
In Cryptology Encryption is term in which real data is preserved in different format such that they are distinct(different)
from the real data.

Encryption Two types:
1. One way Encryption (Only Encryption Possibel)
2. Two way Encryption (Encryption and Descryption both are possible)

One way Encryption :: Only you can encode the data but cannot decode the data

How to Validate
---------------
There encrypted Mechanism remains the same = hash will be diffrent but the way of generating the hash will be same The properties of hash Remains Constant

for example:
in Md5 bit size of hash is 32 bit only

Md5 is a One way Encryption Algorithm
||
||
Message digest version 5

Where to use Md5:
****************
We use Md5 where hash is important but data is not important 
1. Password matching
2. CSRf Protection

Note :: Md5 in Actual Algorithm generate 128 bit character sequencs or signature or finger print
but in PHP it generates 32 bit character 


Salting : Adding some signature or extra token.

Using md5 in data encryption

Date : 15/02/2021
Other Important function for Encryption:
****************************************
sha1() :: Used to generate hash under sha Algorithm
crypt() :: Used to generate hash for standard cryptology Algorithm

These are same as md5 because they follow one way encryption technique
we may use primary Encrypted hash using either by md5,shal,crypt.
One thing is most common in above funvtion is that there hash remains constant

Interview Question:
*******************
Differentitate b/w  md5 sha1 and crypt:-
---------------------------------------
md5:
sha1:
crypt: It is satndard algorithm for Blowfish cryptology (XOR+Binary Addition)
private key and public key both are encrypted + both have random size
hash may differ from 8/16/32 bit

crypt() is a simplest version of Blowfish algorithm.

crypt() can be use two version-
1. With Salting : Hash will be 13 bit and hash will be constant.
2. Without Salting : hash will 34 bit and random.

How to verify the hash generated by crypt
by using
Note :: PHP standard algorithm is Blowfish algorithm.
In php 7 we have standard function to deal with Blowfish Algorithm.
password_hash() :: Random Hash using blowfish Algorithm
	1. PASSWORD_BCRYPT :: By default Blowfish Algorithm+
	2. PASSWORD_DEFAULT 
	3. PASSWORD_ARGON2I 
	4. PASSWORD_ARGON2ID 

Hash will always be random

How to verify
--------------
password_verify() :: It takes two Argument 1st :: password and 2nd ::hash this function will automatically verify the validity of hash.

Two way encryption :
____________________

In two way Encryption encoding and decoding both is possible
here we are intrested in data rather that hash.
here hash is just for encryption purpose or security.

1. base64_encode
2. base64_decode

How two way encryption works:
Data 	|	Middle ware 	|	Target
Client 							Server
 data
 |1234
 |-->	QwmnuRsusD= <---hash
 One way Encodeing			|one way decoding
 								data (1234)

Note :: There is no Such Function which is very secure in two way Encryption Hash Constant

base64_encode = data input Output hash -->Hash Constant
base64_decode = hash input data --> Hash Constant

SQL Injection:-
--------------
we know that sub queries are most at highest priority and will be executed first we try to inject such expression in the from field such that it becomes the part of sql query then database Engine will try to execute that query and some malpractises can be performed at database end.
Such type of Technique is called SQL Injection.

;Drop table test --

How to prevent SQL injection
1. mysqli you have to use 
mysqli_real_escape_string($email)
2. PDO(PHP Database Object) It is pure Object Oriented
3. Prepared Statement
4. Stored procedures



CSRF:
=====
Stands Cross site request forgery is used to  validate weather the request has processed from the same domain or same server.

CSRF is not mendatory in case GET request
But you are using Any Request other than GET
POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS.......
each request must contain CSRF prevention.
