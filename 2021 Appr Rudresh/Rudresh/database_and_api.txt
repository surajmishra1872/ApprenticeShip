PDBC :
Generaly if you want to store data like username, email, password we make varaible but if there are 100's of recored we cannot do anything with variable then we requires array.

Bur this Data Storage Mechanism only remains in Stack Memory.
or
Even if it is stored in heap data is not permanent what I mean is.
Till the php virtual Machine is on and script is Executing the data Remains and As soon Script is terminates PHP Virtual machine comes to Halt(Pause or Terminate state) and data at primary Memory flush Out that means data is destroyed.
 
>Note : PHP Virtual  Machine PHP Interpreter.

In order to make data parmanent we must use parmanent storage Machanism:
1. File System Machanism : Data written into a file is called Fiele Based Storage
	Most Common Feature of Any Framework is to store the exception and data in logs file.

	In Apache or Xampp we have error.log
	

	In order to store the data in log files we need to use file handling

	Write a program to make a Logger 
	Let us make a function write_log($msg): 

	Advantage : 
	___________
	To Log  those request and output which which are implicity called or hit.
	For example:
	Otp Email Services,SMS Services.

	Do our System or Apache 
	php.log

	#Which login technique is used by Server for Authentication
	Session Logging :: Logging a session data into a file

2. Database Mechanism : Data written to a tables in rows and columns
	AMP stack provides Concept of PDBC (PHP Database Connection)
	php can be connected with any database
	Oracle
	mysql
	sybase
	db2
	infomix
	mongodb
	mariadb
	......

	When To use :
	when data is In Lacs and Crores. 

	php is comforatble  with mysql only
	but it can match with any database

	it is Apple to Apple Comparision
	for example
		Ram Sita 
		Krishna Radha
		JAVA Oracle
		Php mysql(past)
		php mariadb

Working  MariaDb or Mysql database:

Here Our database is Mysql but owned Mariadb

there are two types of database
1. Logical Database : Oracle is a Logical Database (Write to memory)
2. Physical Database : mysql or Mariadb is Physical Database(Write the data in form files)

What is proof
==============
goto c:/xampp/mysql/data
						|
						| Here you will get al the data of the database

Database logging : Writting the database related stuff into file system

Database name : foldername
tablename : tbl_tablename.ibd or * .ibd
columns_schema : *.frm

How many Tables you can store or How many .ibd files can be made.
4billions approx

How many *.frm files or columns can be stored in a table
4096 Max

how many ways you can use mysql database
1. using heidi SQL
2. Using MYSQL GUI Tool (Mysql Workbench)
3. Using mysql terminal (console or cmd)
4. Using Webbrowser (PHPMYADMIN)


Working with mysql console:
***************************

mysql> Console or Query
mariaDB> Commands or Query

1. Connect to mysql
goto the Root location
c:/xampp/mysql/bin/

command to connect
Every database has a super user
mysql super user = root
yoy need to connect Root

Syntax:-
	mysql -u <username> -p <password>

	how to connect by hidden
	mysql -u <username>
	Enter Password:
By default password is blank
hit enter

mysql -u root
Enter password : <Hit enter>

Never Ever Set the Mysql path to ENV_VARIABLES
it can be access to by Any Third Party service

Write a Kernal program to execute the Mysql from temperory Environment
Kernal Promming can be done using CMD

@echo off
set /p name=Enter the Username:
set path c:/xampp/mysql/bin/
mysql.exe -u %name% -p
pause

write the to any with extension mysql.cmd


How to show all the database
****************************
MariaDB [(none)]> show databases;
		|
		| Current database name


Mysql Comments
--comment line--

Create the database
MariaDB [(none)]> create database <dbname>;
					|
					|Create command is used to create database object

Database object
1. sequenence
2. trigger
3. cursor
4. view
5. database
6. table
7. user
8. privaleges
9. schemas
10. rights
11. permission
12. temperory table

select/use your database:
	use database;

Since databse is a collection of tables related entities
for example:
database can contain views(virtual Table), Schema, (Tables)

There is a table inside a database what is its name is dual table
dual table = it is a dummy table which has only record no schema(structure) this table is generated at runtime for calculation part 
#Describe <tablename>
You wil get the schema
desc dual; 
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax;


#performing calculation using dual
MariaDB [logs_db]> select 100+10+100 as total_salary from dual;
+--------------+
| total_salary |
+--------------+
|          210 |
+--------------+
1 row in set (0.000 sec)



show the table schema
show tables;

if no table is there
Empty set

Data Structure of a table 
Array : dataType(ENUM, SET)
Variables :
DataTypes
hash
btree
btree+
stack 
queue
index
set = Rows or Records
tuple = this data structure when you insert multiple records in a table.

Creating the Tables
*******************
Syntax :
create table tbl_logs(
id int(11) not null primary key auto_increment,
name varchar(255) not null,
action varchar(255)
);


How to see table schema:
describe <tablename>;
desc <tablename>;


created table query:
show create table <tablename>


Insert data into table:

insert in specific columns
insert into <tablename>(			//into is no mendatary
fieldname-1,
fieldname-2,
fieldname-3
) values(
'value1',
'value2',
'value3',
);


select max(id)+1 as id from tbl_logs as old_logs)

Make using core php make a slug builder just like wordpress 
where you can create post, edit post ,delete post 
each time you create the post tilte should become post url in slug format



Following are the steps to perform crud operation Using database connection:

Step 1:
	Create the database connection:

	mysqli_connect($host,$user,$pass,$dbname);
	return $connection_str or $connection Object

	$con = mysqli_connect($host,$user,$pass,$dbname);
	$con = mysqli_pconnect($host,$user,$pass,$dbname);
				  |
				  |
				  p means : persistant connection (permanant connection)
	Note : I here means Improved version

	dbconnect.php
	since connection is made only once

	$host = '127.0.0.1' or 'lpocalhost';
	$user ='root';
	$pass = '';
	$dbname = ''; no error
	$dbname = 'dbname';
	database name is correct then ok if
	wrong Exception will be raised

Step 2: Check if connection is made or not

	method 1: 
	Via Exceptional handling:

	try{
	$con = mysqli_connect($host,$user,$pass,$dbname);
	echo 'connection created';
	}catch(Exception $e){
		if(!$con){
			die("connection Error".mysqli_error($con));
		}
	}


	method 2:
	Via Conditional Handling:
	if($con){
		echo 'Created Connection';
	}else{
		echo "Connection Error".mysqli_error($con);
		exit;
	}

	method 3:
	Via 
	$con = mysqli_connect($host,$user,$pass,$dbname) or
	die('Connection Error');

Step 3:
	prepare the query and fire the query 

Step 4:
	Justify the Type of Query
	if it is writable or readable

	if query is readable return type will be  result set
	select = result Set

	if query is writable
	return type no of affected rows
	minimum Affected Row 1
	1 => true
	if($check==true){
		echo "Insert ok";	#insert
		echo "Update ok";	#update
		echo "Delete ok";	#delete
	}else{
		echo 'Insert|Delete|Update Error';
	}

Preparing the query:

$sql = "INSERT OR UPDATE OR SELECT OR DELETE QUERY";

Fire the Query:

1. writable
		insert,delete,update,alter,create,drop,truncate.......

		mysqli_query($con,$sql,)
						|	|
						|	|
						|	|sql
						|--->connection Object
		return type : true|false

		Syntax:
		$check = mysqli_query($con,$sql,);

2. readable
	select,joins,projection,selection,transaction
		mysqli_query($con,$sql)
						|	|
						|	|
						|	|sql
						|--->connection Object
		return type : Result set :: Multi-Dimentional Array or N records.

		Syntax:
		$result = mysqli_query($con,$sql);

Note: 
$sql = "Query 1;";
$sql.= "Query 2;";
$sql.= "Query 3;";
$sql.= "Query n;";

mysqli_query($con,$sql);



1. mysqli_num_rows()
2. mysqli_fetch_assoc()
3. mysqli_fetch_array()
4. mysqli_fetch_field()
5. mysqli_fetch_row()


All these function will used during write Operation
writable operation

update or delete
6. mysqli_affected_rows():: no of affected rows in case delete and update.
	
	-1 0 1	min one Affected =>True
	-1 0 (n) max n affected => true
	true
	|
	|--->when query is failed

	$check_count = mysqli_affected_rows($con);

	if($check_count>0){

	}



insert
7. mysqli_insert_id()
		gives the id of last inserted Record

select max(id) from any_table

postermartam of Result set Function
********************************


1. mysqli_num_rows()
2. mysqli_fetch_assoc()
3. mysqli_fetch_array()
4. mysqli_fetch_field()
5. mysqli_fetrch_row()


This result is also called Resource and denoted by #n
where n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8............

$con :: is responsible for profiling
SQL Query
Explain <Any-Query>

In oredr to check the unique wheather a record exist or not
we use count $count > 0 record exist

Select Query::
mysqli_num_rows($result_set);




update tbl_logs set name Abd where(select name from tbl_logs where id=1 ) 

Important Transactional queries
*******************************

Any Task or event Achieved by running multiple Queries is called as Trancaction.

Some Example of Transaction are
1. Balance Transfer :: Transaction

ac1			ac2

$update_for_ac1 = "UPDATE QUERY...";
if(mysqli_query($con,$update_for_ac1)){
	$affected_count = mysqli_affected_rows($con);
	if($affected_count>0){
		echo "Balance Debited";

		$update_for_ac2 ="Query Second..";
		if(mysqli_query($con,$update_for_ac2)){
			$affected_count2 = mysqli_affected_rows($con);
			if($affected_count2>0){
				echo "Balance Debited";

				//
				$select_sql = "Select from ac2";
				$result_set = mysqli_query($con,$select_sql);
				$count = mysqli_num_rows($result_set);
				if($count2>0){
					echo "creadited";
				}
		}

	}else{
		echo 'Not inserted';
		write_log('Not inserted'.mysqli_error($con));
	}
}



Alter |Drop |Create Query: 

if(mysqli_query($con,$sql)){
	echo 'Query Executed';
}else{
	echo 'Query Not Executed'.mysqli_error($con);
}

Q1. if record exist update and if not insert
make a upsert function

Q2. select the record then update the record.

Q3. select table 2 if exist delete from table2
and move to table1




Working with Readable Queries
*****************************
Check the state of query if state of auery is readble this means query is select
weather it is projection OR selection

Projection means :: No where clause
Selection means :: With where clause

Working with projection:
************************
Projection :: result set will be n
count of result set = num_rows

According to programming ther are two types of loop
1. entry control loop
		for :: limit must be known
		while :: No limit is known
		foreach :: No limit is known

2. exit control	loop
		do while

Here we can use while or foreach:

Working with selection
**********************
0:1:n
| | |
| | |-->n records
| |-->1 record
|-->>Null

selection :: where clause will be added
syntax:
select <column-set> from <tablename> where <column> <condition> <value>
or <column-2> <condition> <value2> or|and...........

condition can be 
equal to =
not equal to != , <>
greater than >
less than >
greater than or equal to >=
less than or equal to >=

column to vlaue comparison
left to right comparison

to check if it is NULL
select email from tbl_user where email ='';			#invalid Query
select email from tbl_user where email is NULL;		#valid Query


to check if it is not null
==========================
select email from tbl_user where email is not NULL;		#valid Query

Selection of specific record
----------------------------
Clause<condition> is directly to <uniquess> only and operation

narrowing result set : and 
widening result	set : or


select email,password,mobile ferom tbl_user where email='$email' and password='$password' and moile='$mobile';

if():

type conversion from database to server datatype
-------------------------------------------------
Php			database
into		sql

creating the slug page:

1. Add the header to the table <th>view post</th>
go to tbody and <td><a href="posts.php?slug=<?php $row['slug'];?>"></a></td>

2. Make the page posts.php
and get the slug variable

$slug = $_GET['slug'];

we need to make preety url so we use htaccess
and write the rule for query string of get request

RewriteRule ^(posts)/([a-z0-9\-]+)$ posts.php?slug=$2 [QSA]

Now change the url in show .php
<a href="posts/<?php echo $row['slug']?>"></a>
